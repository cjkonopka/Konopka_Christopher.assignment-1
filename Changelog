# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2016-26-01
### Added
-Dungeon Generator: five to ten rooms at least two by three in dimension are randomly generated and added to a 21 by 80 dungeon.
-rocks are represented with spaces, rooms with periods.
-After the rooms are placed they are randomly connected via corridors represented with "#"

## [0.1.1] - 2016-01-02
### Added
-Fixed a glitch that caused the program to crash when too many large of rooms where generated to be placed in the dungeon.
-a save function that writes the dungeon data to .rlg327 in home directory. called via --save.
-a loading function that reads the dungeon data from .rlg327 in home directory. called via --load.
-both can be called at the same time.
-Writing and reading are done in big endian.

## [0.1.3] - 2016-06-02
### Added
- a PlayerCharacter that is represented with a '@' 
	the @ is created a placed in a random room of the dungeon after creation.
	the @ will not spawn adjacent to a room wall unless the room has a height of 2.
-a method that prints out the dungeon in terms of distance from the @ without tunneling through rocks.
	0-9 represents distances 0-10, a-z represents distances 10-35, A-Z represents distances 36-61.
	distances greater than 61 are printed as their normal characters.
-a method that prints out the dungeon in terms of distance from the @ that  allows tunneling through rocks.
	rocks with hardnesses in the ranges [1, 84], [85, 170], and [171, 254] have weights of 1, 2, and 3, respectively
	the same printing rules and character codes  from the no tunneling method apply.

## [0.1.4] - 2016-13-02
### Added
-a Util header to store structs, macros, and constants
	-several new structs including monster and character
	-macros to define the type of monster
-a method that makes the player character move randomly
-a switch "--nummon" that allows the addition of a specified amount of monsters
-a monster class to create 16 variations of monster
	-each variation behaves differently based on the hexadecimal number's bits
	-first bit:intelligence, second bit: telepathy, third bit: tunneling, forth bit: erratic
-a method to place these monsters in the dungeon
-a method to move these monsters according to their type
-a priority queue that controls when the player and the monsters move
-an ability to win if there are no monsters or lose if a monster kills the player

## [0.1.5] - 2016-08-03
### Added
-Fixed a segmentation fault issue with non tunneling monsters

-an up and down stairwell in each dungeon
-ability to go up and down levels using < and > at the respective stairwells in dungeon
-a monster list, that gives all the positions of the monsters
-a way to exit with 'S'

## [0.1.6] - 2016-22-03
### Added
-character.cpp and character.h
-converted monster and player to cpp files

-fixed numerous bugs relating to wrappers/classes/pointers created by the conversion to c++
-got previous functionality to fully work without memory leaks or crashes
-multiple methods in player to enable Fog of War
-Fog of war remembers terrain but not monster position after monsters aren't visible
-Valgrind memory leak errors fixed dealing with delete.
-fixed multiple memory/seg fault issues

## [0.1.7] - 2016-03-04
