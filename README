This program reads in descriptions of both monsters and objects. It then creates instances of these based on the specifications to be placed into the dungeon. Once created, most of the variables are stored as ints besides damage. Damage is kept as dice to be rolled later. The dungeon is then created like normal with fog of war. Monsters now have the appropriate symbols and colors. 10 items randomly spawn throughout the dungeon on every floor. The item's symbols and color correspond to description. Items can be walked over by characters without effect. Item stacking and passing is not implemented.--nummon switch still works but moving floors spawns a random number of monsters.
